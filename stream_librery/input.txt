Read-only 

Functions that do IO typically pass and return the stream through refences
Reading or writing an IO object changes its state, so the reference must not be const.

We can use an object of an inherited type in places where an object of the original type is experted.
This fact means that functions that are written to take a reference (or pointer) to one of the iostream 
type can be called on behalf of the corresponding fstream (or sstream) type. That is, if we have a function 
that take an ostream& , we can call that function passing it an ofstream object, and similarly for istream& and ifstream

When an fstream object goes out of scope, the file it is bound to is automatically closed.

THE IOSTREAM CLASSES HANDLE IO TO CONSOLE

THE FSTREAM CLASSES HANDLE IO TO NAMED FILES

THE STRINGSTREAM CLASSES DO IO TO IN-MEMORY STRINGS

the FSTREAM and STRINGSTREAM classes are related by inheritance to the IOSTREAM classe, so OPERATION in istream object can also be perform on either an IFSTREAM or ISTRINGSTREAM 
Similarly for OUTPUT
